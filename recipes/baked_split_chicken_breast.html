    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a very easy but elegant recipe that looks like you've spent 
        hours in the kitchen when you've barely lifted a finger! The base recipe yields 
        2 servings and the time spent baking the chicken is dependant on 
        the <strong><em>thickness</em></strong> of the breast.</p>
    <p>Feel free to scale up this recipe for more guests! The prep time is minimal 
        regardless of whether you make 2 breasts or 20.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>
