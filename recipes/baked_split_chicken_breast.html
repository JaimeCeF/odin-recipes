    <h2 class="subtit">Description</h2>
    <p>This is a very easy but elegant recipe that looks like you've spent 
        hours in the kitchen when you've barely lifted a finger! The base recipe yields 
        2 servings and the time spent baking the chicken is dependant on 
        the <strong><em>thickness</em></strong> of the breast.</p>
    <p>Feel free to scale up this recipe for more guests! The prep time is minimal 
        regardless of whether you make 2 breasts or 20.</p>

    <h2 class="subtit">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingr">
        <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="subtit">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>First</p>
        <p>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with 
            salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in 
            a large baking dish and refrigerate at least 45 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Then</p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Lastly</p>
        <p>Bake in preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at 
            the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An 
            instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the 
            breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</p></li>
    </ol>
